# 前言

This is the textbook I home some like Professor David Gries would write --and, since the latter has no rivals, than means I just hoped he would wirte it. [?The topic deserves no lesser author.?]

我一直希望有一位类似David Gries这样的牛人能写一本该主题的书，甚至认为David Gries才是最适合的,对于这一点应该是没什么疑议的。

The difference between the "old program" and the "new program" is as profound as the difference between a conjecture and a proven theorem, between pre-scientific knowledge of mathematical facts and consequences[影响] rigorously[严格的] deduced[推理] from a body of postulates[假设].

在过去10年，“编程”的概念的潜在含义发生了极大的改变。在过去10年与现在相比编程的概念都是指在电脑上运行一段代码。除了二者字面意思相同，二者是极不相同的，如果不加区分的把二者用相同的术语描述一定会让人感到困惑. 新老编程概念的区别如同理论证明和猜想的区别，或者像零散的数学知识与经过严格的形式化推理而形成的理论体系之间的区别。

Remembering how many centuries it has taken Mankind to appreciate fully the profundity of this latter distinction , we get a glimpse of the edu-cational challenge we are facing:besides teaching technicalities, we have to overcome the mental resistance always evoked when it is shown how the techniques of scientific thought can be fruitfully applied to a next area of human endeavor.

深刻领会后面二者的区别花费了人类好几个世纪，我们了解到一些教育面临的挑战，包括：教学技巧、当把科学领域的技巧应用到其它领域时所面临的心理障碍。

It does not suffice[足够] just to explain the formal machinery that enables us to design "new programs". New formalisms are always frightening, and it takes much careful teaching to convince the novice that the formalism is not only helpful but even indispensable.
Choice and order of examples are as imporot as the good taste with which the formalism is applied.[???] To get the message across requires a scientist that combines his scientific involvement in the subject with the precious gifts of a devoted teacher.[???] We should consider ourselves fortunate that Professor Daid Gries has met the challenge.

仅仅通过解释我们进行新的编程概念的机制来让人们使用新编程概念，这样的力度是不够的。新的形式化的编程概念有些令人畏惧，需要花费大量教学技巧让学生深信形式化不仅有用而且必要。提供教学的事例的选择和安排如同品尝美食的顺序一样重要。而这种教学技巧的信息的获取需要从一个既做科研又热爱教学的老师上身获取。幸运的是，Daid Gries教授恰好满足这些要求。
